## Q7

Economic development: Albuquerque business owners have reported that getting permits can take 6 months or longer, and needless 'red tape' stifles efforts to open or expand.What will you do to speed up business permits and other business requirements to encourage economic development, business expansion, and new businesses?

As  a small business  owner,  and the only  business  owner in the race I  understand how critical it  is  to get  businesses  back  up and running in Albuquerque. We need to streamline the permit process by ensuring it can be done quickly and efficiently online with support that  guides  business  owners  step-by-step through the process.  We should partner with the chamber of  commerce to connect  with businesses  on how to make the permit  process  easier for them.  The more business  friendly  we are,  the more economic  development we'll see.

## Q8

Homelessness: Albuquerque's homeless population has grown exponentially in the past few years and is creating problems for both the homeless and the residents of the city. Please answer the following questions:Do you support or oppose expanding legal 'safe outdoor spaces' for camps around Albuquerque?

## Q9

What is your plan to deal with illegal encampments in the city?

Again, sleep is to be decriminalized, and if encampments are to be removed for safety precautions, it will be ensured each person obtains all their belongings and is given options and resources for shelters or transitional housing, and eventually a ride to a Home Basis  Center,  which can also help them  acquire identification papers  if  previously  lost.

## Please Explain:

I am supportive of providing safe housing solutions, but the city's previous solutions have fallen short. The city tried this initiative to house 100 people on a dirt  lot  and failed miserably,  as  well as  more sparse "affordable"  housing barely reaching the 100s while thousands fight to survive on our  streets.  Firstly,  I  will  decriminalize  sleep,  ensuring  this is  a rest  friendly  city.  Everyone knows  ever since they cleared people from the 2nd Street Park, it has driven encampments closer to neighborhoods and into alleys. The city budget will be adjusted for more public restrooms while we build our first Home Basis Center, which will house 200 free sleep "capsules"  to New Mexicans  &amp;  unsheltered,  as well as another 200 accessible units with lockable doors. Home Basis Centers are not a bandaid but a community solution, not only housing people, but helping them build a sustainable home.

## Q10

Do you support using taxpayer dollars for homeless programs? If you support, what kind of programs would you seek to fund?

## Q11

Will you cooperate with or oppose federal agencies regarding the deportation of those who have entered the U.S. illegally and are a threat to society?

## Q12

Crime: Albuquerque is in a crime crisis, and is one of the most dangerous cities of its size in the U.S. Please answer the following:How would you empower the Albuquerque police force to better address this situation?

We need to fully  staff  our police department  and make sure they  are present  and ingrained in the community.  I  would fund our police with detective incentives  to strategically  protect  and fund more training to address  this  nuanced city's  history,  prioritizing de-escalation, and attention to disability  and mental illness.  I  would also put  transparency  in place to make sure the top brass  is  held accountable for how they are allocating their budget.

## Q13

Some businesses are afraid to call for police assistance when a crime is committed because they don't want to be labeled a nuisance property. What will you do to ensure that businesses are receiving proper police protection?

The nuisance property ordinance punishes property and business owners rather than going after crime itself. I would work with business  owners  and  law enforcement  detectives  to  strategically  make  crime  hotspots  safer.

## Q14

Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina was involved in a highly controversial car crash. The corruption within APD, including high-ranking officials on DWI cases, is alarming. On the positive side, it was recently announced that the Department of Justice consent decree will soon end. If elected, would you retain or replace Chief Medina?

## Replace,

Please explain::

Not only is there no accountability from the top ranks of the police force, but the way it's currently operating is clearly ineffective.  We  need  to  install  leaders  who  are  tough  as nails and straight as an arrow in our police department.

## Support,

Please explain::

I think most Albuquerque residents understand anyone is less than one paycheck away from houselessness. It is a collective effort to keep Albuquerque liveable. Home Basis Centers are not only meant for unhoused populations, but ensuring and filling in the holes residents may find themselves overworking themselves out of to stay off the streets. They will be equipped with public restrooms, showers, gardens, kitchens, gyms and more, as many residents barely afford rent, they can at least be fed, along with the opportunity of real rent assistance.

Please explain::

I  do  not believe in targeting residents who are just living their  lives.  In  cases  of  violent  offenders,  I  will  absolutely cooperate to ensure that they answer for their crimes.

## Q15

How will you stop the open drug dealing and drug use in Albuquerque?

Simply  ensuring our detectives  have the resources  to find the sources  of  drug trafficking and other forms  of  trafficking will exponentially reduce the harmful impact of drugs on our streets. Additionally, I would partner with schools to educate youth on the not only  the dangers  of  illegal drugs,  but  scientifically  how they  affect  the brain,  how to say  no to leverage,  and the resources  available before and after one gets addicted.

| If elected, would you expand, reduce, or maintain the size of Albuquerque's Government? If applicable, please explain where growth or reduction would occur and how. | Please explain:: I'm pretty confident we have some wasteful spending going on in our city. As a business owner, I understand operational budgets and am not afraid to make cuts to unnecessary spending and efforts that are not yielding results for taxpayers. |

## Q17

What specific plans do you have to improve Albuquerque's infrastructure and road conditions, and how will you prioritize and fund these improvements?

We should adopt a worst first policy  with an efficient and strong collaboration with Albuquerque's  private businesses, to repave roads, update and streamline traffic stops and high traffic areas.
