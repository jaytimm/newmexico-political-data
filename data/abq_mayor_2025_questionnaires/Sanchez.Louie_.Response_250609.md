## Q7

Economic development: Albuquerque business owners have reported that getting permits can take 6 months or longer, and needless 'red tape' stifles efforts to open or expand.What will you do to speed up business permits and other business requirements to encourage economic development, business expansion, and new businesses?

Currently as a City Councilor, I am working to streamline the entire permitting process by bringing all departments involved in economic development under a single, coordinated strategy. We currently  have monthly  meetings  with the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Authority,  Planning,  NAIOP and developers  to streamline the process.  We have put  together a checklist  to keep everyone needing the system in the lane they  need to be in,  based on their needs.  From day  one,  I'll continue to lead a citywide push to eliminate unnecessary red tape and create a faster, more predictable pathway for new and growing businesses. Making Albuquerque a businessfriendly  city  isn't  just  a goal - it's  a top priority,  and I'm committed to delivering real change that  supports  entrepreneurs,  job creation, and long-term economic growth. Here are a few priority items:

Implement a One-Stop Business  Portal:  As  a small business  owner and a current  City  Councilor,  I  know how frustrating it  is  to navigate  Albuquerque's  disconnected city  systems.  Our  small  businesses  don't  have  time  to  battle  bureaucracy-they  need  a centralized,  easy-to-use portal or checklist  that  provides  real-time access  to permits,  resources,  and support.  As  Mayor,  I'll modernize how the city  serves  entrepreneurs  by  creating a unified platform  that's  efficient,  transparent,  and tailored to the needs  of  small  and microbusinesses. With better data tracking,  live support,  and clear guidance,  we'll turn city  government into a true partner for business growth-because making Albuquerque more business-friendly  benefits  all of us.

Cut Red Tape: I hear from developers and small business owners every week about delayed permits that cost time, money, and trust. We must  cut  the red tape by  streamlining approvals,  hiring experienced inspectors,  and setting clear,  transparent  timelines.  Small businesses  deserve the same level of  support  and urgency  we give to major companies.  As  Mayor,  I'll make permitting faster,  fairer, and more predictable-because when we help local businesses  grow,  we create jobs,  strengthen neighborhoods,  and build a more vibrant Albuquerque for all.

Set  Clear Timelines  and Accountability:  I've seen how unpredictable timelines  can frustrate businesses.  Every  permit  process  should come with a clear,  department-driven timeline based on real  capacity.  Setting expectations  and holding departments  accountable is key.  We'll  explore automatic  approvals  when deadlines  are missed and use data reviews  to make sure delays  are addressed.  Simple tools  like  website graphics,  signage,  and staff  training will  make the process  more transparent  and easier to navigate-for both the public and city employees. We will make sure phone numbers are available and phones are answered.  Directors and Deputy Directors will  be held accountable to the public  for answering questions  and moving the process  forward.

Create a Business  Concierge Team:  As  Mayor,  one of  my  top priorities  will be transforming the current  Small Business  Office into a modern,  high-impact  Innovation and Business  Resource Center.  Originally  intended to help business  owners  navigate city  services, this  office must  be reimagined to meet  today's  needs  with clarity,  accessibility,  and efficiency.  This  center should treat  every  business, whether it's  a food truck,  retail  shop,  or tech startup,  with the same level  of  importance and support  as  any  significant  economic development  project.  This  new center will  be staffed by  experienced,  bilingual  business  advisors  who understand the challenges entrepreneurs  face and are committed to helping them succeed. We will leverage technology  to create a true one-stop shop, streamlining access  to resources,  cutting red tape,  and accelerating business  growth.  It  will  also offer tailored services  like procurement  readiness,  business  permitting assistance,  and connections  to financial  tools.  This  is  about  more than renaming an office,  it's  about  building a culture of  service,  innovation,  and economic  opportunity  for Albuquerque's  future.  By  positioning our small businesses as vital engines of job creation and neighborhood revitalization, we can fuel inclusive, long-term prosperity  for Albuquerque. Modernize Technology  and Staff  Training:  One area where the city  needs  to see substantial improvement  is  in its  ability  to collect  and interpret  data.  Staying  competitive and even setting standards  for cities  our size will  happen if  we modernize our systems,  software, collection of  data,  and use of AI technology  in training our city  employees to be the best customer service agents  with knowledge of all the resources  the city  has  to offer.  The basics  of  customer service will  be a top priority  along with the passion for economic development,  small  business  growth and setting the foundation for the city  to thrive for generations  to come.  We give the city employees  the ability  to participate in the streamlining of  the processes  since they  know it  better than anyone.

Engage with the Business Community: As a small business owner, I understand the value of staying connected to our local business community.  Listening directly  to business  owners-through business  fairs,  forums,  and peer-led panels-is  essential  to understanding their challenges  and identifying real  solutions.  By  fostering these conversations,  we can lead a grassroots  movement  to rebuild and grow what was lost in the wake of the pandemic. Currently, the city has nearly 60 boards and commissions, but only one dedicated to small business-and it represents just two of our nine council districts. That's  not good enough. As  Mayor, I will prioritize restructuring

## 2025 ABQ Mayoral Candidate Questionnaire

this  board to ensure all districts  have a seat  at  the table,  and its  mission is  aligned with the needs  of  today's  entrepreneurs. Additionally,  I  will host  monthly  roundtables  with local business  owners-not just to address  concerns, but to recognize successes  and build a city  government  that  works  hand-in-hand with the business  community.  Together,  we'll create a stronger economy  for Albuquerque.

Engage and help more business start ups along the central corridor, currently we have a massive drug and homeless population along the Central corridor and too many  closed businesses.  We need to work  on enforcement of all laws  in the books  along central and replace the drugs  and unhoused with thriving businesses.  Currently  I  have the City  exploring the Idea for either removing the ART project  based on the fact  that  it  has  caused a negative impact  on our city  to forgive clawback  and or open up ART for more left  hand turns  which will bring back our Rout 66 to welcome our centennial celebration of the Mother Road.  This  is  urgent and will be an immediate priority day one

By  making it  easier to start  and grow a business  in Albuquerque,  we can replace 'closed' signs  with 'open' ones,  light  up our storefronts, create good-paying jobs, revitalize our neighborhoods, and build a stronger, more resilient local economy. As Mayor, that will be a central part of my vision for Albuquerque's future.

## Q8

Homelessness: Albuquerque's homeless population has grown exponentially in the past few years and is creating problems for both the homeless and the residents of the city. Please answer the following questions:Do you support or oppose expanding legal 'safe outdoor spaces' for camps around Albuquerque?

## Please Explain:

While the intention may  be to offer temporary  relief,  the reality is that these encampments often become long-term and  do  little  to  address  the  root  causes  of  homelessness. We cannot enable a system that normalizes life on the streets-it's  neither  compassionate,  Humane  nor sustainable for individuals or our communities. Instead, we need real, results-driven solutions that treat homelessness and addiction with urgency and dignity with a humane approach. That means investing in transitional housing with built-in  access  to  mental  health  services,  addiction recovery, job training,Job connect and wraparound support. We must also create clear pathways out of homelessness through accountability, outreach, and partnerships with faithbased organizations, nonprofits, and public health experts. We will also need directed programs  placed by  the courts after  incarceration  to  move  people  to  recovery  who  want help or need a push to get  it.  On City  Council  I  put guardrails in place to protect the operations and comprehensive  rules  and  regulations  governing  Safe Outdoor  Spaces  (SOS).  Our  city  deserves  clean,  safe public spaces-and our unhoused neighbors deserve a path to stability, not a sidewalk. As Mayor, I'll prioritize bold, innovative strategies that reduce street homelessness and restore  safety,  health,  and  opportunity  for  all  of Albuquerque. Addiction is incredibly difficult to overcomeespecially  when  drug  traffickers  threaten  your  life  to  keep you addicted and working for them. We must confront the drug cartels that have a stranglehold on our city. These criminal organizations are exploiting and endangering our unhoused population, growing their operations because past administrations have turned a blind eye. I will not ignore the massive drug crisis  in Albuquerque.  I  will  confront  it  headon, with determination and urgency.

## Q9

## What is your plan to deal with illegal encampments in the city?

Illegal encampments are not a long-term solution-for the unhoused or for our CITY neighborhoods. We must be clear: living in unsafe, unsanitary  conditions  on sidewalks,  in parks,  or near schools  is  not  compassionate,  and it's  not  acceptable or humane.  But enforcement  alone is  not  the answer.  We need a plan that  balances  accountability  with real pathways  to stability.

As  a 26-year retired acting commander in APD,  I  have never seen such a huge homelessness  crisis  with its  root  cause being drug use, addiction and trafficking of fentanyl which keeps people from wanting help  or willing to help themselves, the drug dealers control most  encampments  through fear and intimidation.  As  Mayor,  I  will implement  a plan to address  illegal activity  in and around encampments  humanely,  effectively  which will  lead to helping those who can now ask  for help without  threat.

1. Coordinated Outreach &amp;  Engagement:  Deploy  trained outreach teams  including social  workers  and behavioral  health professionals,  to engage individuals  in encampments  daily, offering services,  shelter options,  and personalized plans  for recovery  and stability.  Setting the standard that  living on the street  is  not  an option.

2. Immediate Access  to Transitional Housing:  Expand access  to clean,  safe,  low-barrier transitional housing connected to support services  like job placement,  mental  health care,  and addiction recovery.  Other cities  around the country  have great  models,  for example,  72-hour addiction detox  and 72-hour mental evaluation holds.  During these hours,  the city  engagement  teams  will look  to notify  possible family  members,  help those that  choose to return to their home state and directed services  after incarceration provide additional  long-term  support  to facilitate other options  than living on the street.

3. Strengthen Encampment  Response Teams:  Establish a trained dedicated,  city-led encampment  response team  that  works  in coordination with outreach staff  and coordinated city  non-profits  to clean up sites  swiftly  and compassionately,  ensuring those offered services  are not  left  behind.  Following up with resources  that  the homeless  may  not  know exist,  or offering opportunities  to get  back home to their loved ones  will be another tool  to begin to clear the neighborhoods  and streets.

4. Zero-Tolerance Zones: Tourist Zones, Near Schools, Parks, and Businesses: For the city  to have a targeted focus  on economic dollars  that  are raised through tourism, we will need to implement zero-tolerance zones  such as  downtown, historical sites, community neighborhoods  like Nob Hill and Old town. We will need to protect  public  spaces  with clearly  designated no-camping zones  and firm, consistent  enforcement.  Additionally,  areas  around schools,  childcare centers,  parks,  and small  businesses  will  also be included in these zones.

5. Accountability  Through Diversion Programs:  Partnering with courts  to create diversion programs  that  hold individuals accountable while connecting them to treatment, housing, and job-readiness  resources. Understanding that  enabling them to live on the street  does  not  allow for them  to become a productive and contributing members  of  our city.

6. Invest in Long-Term Solutions: Prioritize permanent supportive housing development, workforce solutions, and regional partnerships  to address  root  causes  and reduce the inflow of  homelessness  across  the city.

We can't ignore this crisis, and we can't enable it to grow. My plan is rooted in compassion and accountability because Albuquerque deserves  safe streets,  and every  resident  deserves  a path to dignity  and opportunity.

## Q10

Do you support using taxpayer dollars for homeless programs? If you support, what kind of programs would you seek to fund?

## Please explain::

Homelessness is a problem that has overtaken the city and affects  all  our neighborhoods.  So,  this  initiative would have to be partially funded by the city, state and federal entities.. Programs  that  effectively  reduce  homelessness  and improve public safety and quality of life will be priority. Pointing out that getting the homelessness problem under control is not forever, but initially it would have to be funded. But that support comes with a strong commitment to accountability, transparency, and results. Currently we have no accountability on programs that are in place. The good programs point out the bad programs who are funded the same as good programs but are not producing results. We need to audit the trending programs that have fancy names and are only in it for the money and replace them with solid programs  that  can prove results.  This  is  tax  payer money and we need to take care of it. The ultimate goal will be to have a home of  their own and a job to pay  for ther lively hood. I would prioritize funding for the following types of programs: Transitional and Supportive Housing: Programs that provide stable housing with wraparound services like mental  health  care,  job  training,  and  addiction  treatment have been proven to reduce chronic homelessness in other cities  that have been able to clean up their streets. Emergency Shelters: Shelters and safe locations for people to go that are open 24/7, allow pets and partners. But these shelters would require sobriety, evaluations, and other surveys to hold the person accountable for the next step. Mental Health and Substance Use Treatment: A sizable percentage of people experiencing homelessness are also dealing with addiction and behavioral health issues. Expanding access to treatment is essential for long-term recovery and mental health care. Street Outreach and Navigation  Services:  Outreach  teams  are  often  the  first point  of  contact  for people living on the streets.  Teams trained in trauma-informed care who can build trust, connect individuals  to services,  and help them  navigate the system will be part of the program. Prevention Programs: It's more cost-effective to keep people housed than to help them after they  become homeless.  I  support  rental  assistance programs, and other programs that help people transition out of institutions without ending up on the streets. Every dollar we spend should be tied to measurable outcomes. I will ensure that taxpayer investments are targeted, tracked, and continuously evaluated and audited so we're funding what works-not just what feels good.

## Q11

Will you cooperate with or oppose federal agencies regarding the deportation of those who have entered the U.S. illegally and are a threat to society?

## Please explain::

As  mayor,  my  priority  will  always  be  to  protect  the  safety and well-being of  Albuquerque residents.  I  will  cooperate with federal  agencies  when it  comes  to individuals  who are in the country illegally and who pose a clear threat to public safety, such as those involved in violent crime, drug and human trafficking,  or  gang  activity.  However,  I  do  not support broad, indiscriminate immigration enforcement actions that target law-abiding members of our immigrant communities or sow fear among families. Local law enforcement should focus on local crime, not act as an arm of  a  federal  department.  In my  26 years  of  policing,  we never arrested on anything other than the crime being committed. There were federal agencies that held offices within  our jails  and  departments  to do the work  for the federal agencies. That would be something I would consider advocating for. (not sure about this last sentence) We will maintain clear protocols to ensure due process and to distinguish between serious criminal threats and those who are simply trying to build a better life. Community trust in public  safety  institutions  is  critical,  and  we  will  not  erode that trust. Public safety and human dignity can and must go hand in hand.

## Q12

Crime: Albuquerque is in a crime crisis, and is one of the most dangerous cities of its size in the U.S. Please answer the following:How would you empower the Albuquerque police force to better address this situation?

I  will not have to worry about firing the current police chief, he already knows he is not welcome.  He has shown his troops that it is ok to have double standards as a chief and have a strict standard for his rank and file which he has proven over and over.  The Mayor is the police chief and this mayor has  failed you when it comes  to Law Enforcement.  My  priority is to RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST in our police department.  The word is  out  across  the country,  'Who wants  to work  for APD when the Mayor and his  Chief  have double standards' the answer is  'NOT ME'.  That  is  the true reason we are having a more difficult  time hiring officers.

To effectively  address  Albuquerque's  crime crisis,  we must  reevaluate the current  police department  to allow officers  to do their job and to be given the tools,discretion and resources  they  need to combat  crime and earn the trust of  the public  by  enforcing all laws  on the books.  Discretion has  been removed by  this  administration. The citizens  trust  of  the Albuquerque Police Department  must  be restored and will be restored. The first  priority  will  be to attack  the criminal  drug gangs  and the fentanyl  crisis.  Currently  APD leadership has  alienated itself  from other local Law Enforcement  Agencies  breaking Community  Law Enforcement engagement, shown on recent  Law Enforcement  endeavors  leaving APD out.  Immediate re engagement  in multi agency  cooperation will be restored and used to protect  our community.  Field Service,  or officers  in marked patrol  units  are the backbone to all  police departments  except APD.  APD proves over and over by  not currently  being able to provide the services  that  the community  expects  and deserves.  Field Services  Officers  wearing professional uniforms  will be a standard and will be the best  paid and most  rewarding positions.  We will make sure to build the Field Services  to have the respect  they  deserve and ability  to serve above and beyond the call of  duty.

1. Rebrand the police department:  rebranding the department  to include a new mission,  vision and values,  officer's  oath,  logo, colors, and new name. What the department has lost is the trust and respect of the community. A fresh reset allows officers to regain their passion for the job and the community  to establish added support  for our men and women who protect  our streets  daily.

2. New Organizational Chart: Along with a rebrand, a new alignment of top brass, management and putting more officers into the field will be day  one priority.  While working with a new strategy  for the department and interim management to be able to make the necessary  changes  before,  we do a nationwide search for the next  qualified police chief.

3. Fully  staff  the  department:  With the help of  strong marketing,  develop a strategic  plan for recruiting new officers  to the department. Although this may have to be a long-term plan as the department is severely understaffed, seasoned officers will be the key to training and support of a new department.

4. Retain Officers:  Developing an aggressive retention program by  offering qualified, eager,  and passionate officers  competitive pay, mental health support,  and a modernized work  environment  including the latest  software and technology  will  be an immediate improvement  to support  those officers  who are willing to stay  a little longer with the department.  There will be a transition period while recruiting is  taking place.  Nothing can replace the experience of  a seasoned officer.

5. Invest  in Targeted,  Data-Driven Policing:  In today's  world,  the use of  data to track  areas  of  improvements,  pain points  and programs within the department will be implemented to enhance public safety. Analytics and AI are essentials in the strategy  of the department.  Data does  not  lie.  It  allows  for educated decisions  and forecasting for changes  and improvements  in the police departments that the public will have high expectations of.

6. Ensure Accountability  and Transparency:  Creating a police department  that  feels  empowered will  not  be an easy  task,  but through accountability  and transparency  within the department  and to the public, it can be achieved.  Officers  must  hold themselves  to the highest standards  and to help them feel empowered the department will invest in training at all levels  to ensure that  officers  are able to do their jobs  without  their hands  tied behind their backs.  This  in turn will  allow transparency  and accountability.

Albuquerque deserves a police department that is professional, responsive, and that our community is proud of. I will lead with both urgency  and balance to restore safety  and trust  in our police department.

## Q13

Some businesses are afraid to call for police assistance when a crime is committed because they don't want to be labeled a nuisance property. What will you do to ensure that businesses are receiving proper police protection?

No business should ever feel discouraged from calling the police when a crime occurs. If our policies  are making law-abiding business owners  afraid to seek  help,  then those policies  are failing and must  be reformed.

As mayor, I will take the following steps to ensure businesses receive the protection they deserve:

Reform the Nuisance Property Ordinance: We will revise the ordinance so that repeated calls for police service due to external criminal activity  do not  penalize businesses  that  are victims  not  perpetrators  of  crime.  A  business  doing the right  thing should not  be treated like a problem.

Clarify  Enforcement  Guidelines:  I  will direct  the city  to issue clear,  public  guidelines  that  distinguish between nuisance activity  and legitimate calls  for help.  Officers  and property  owners  alike need to know where the lines  are drawn.

Support for Business Safety Plans: I'll establish a partnership program where businesses in high-crime areas can work proactively with police and city  departments  to create safety  plans,  access  resources,  and prevent  crime without  fear of  being labeled nuisances.

Boost Patrols  in Commercial Corridors: By  increasing foot and vehicle patrols  in high-traffic  business  zones, we can deter criminal activity  and reduce the need for repeated 911 calls  in the first  place.

Listen to the Business  Community: I will regularly  meet with local business  leaders  to understand their safety  concerns  and adjust city policy  to support  and not  punish those trying to keep their doors  open and their customers  safe.  Public  safety  is  a partnership,  and businesses  are on the front  lines.  I'll  make sure they're treated as  partners  not  liabilities.

## Q14

Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina was involved in a highly controversial car crash. The corruption within APD, including high-ranking officials on DWI cases, is alarming. On the positive side, it was recently announced that the Department of Justice consent decree will soon end. If elected, would you retain or replace Chief Medina?

## Please explain::

Any Reasonable person who watches the video of Medina's crash  with  him  almost  killing  an  innocent  citizen  can  see that something is not right. An honest Chief would have himself  called for an independent  outside investigation to hold  himself  accountable  and  set  an  example  to  his  troops of true accountability and transparency, instead he set a double standard that  has  continued to undermine the trust our community has for their police department. This is a disgusting  example  of  leadership  and  mayor  Keller condoned this by inferring that his Chief is the victim putting himself  and his  chief  above the law and above the citizens of  Albuquerque. Absolutely  not.  I  will  not  retain  Chief Medina. Public trust in law enforcement begins at the top. The recent controversy involving Chief Medina, combined with ongoing concerns about integrity within APD's leadership, raises serious questions about accountability, transparency  and culture inside the department.  If elected,the current  chief  will be fired and he already  knows he  is  not  welcome  in  my  administration  since  I  called  for him to be fired and a vote of no confidence. That also goes for his  administrative staff.  .  T  new leadership is  necessary to move the department forward and restore public confidence and morale with the rank and file. Currently they have been intimidated and are even afraid to sign a petition for me even if  they  are off  duty  for fear of  retaliation.  I  will not hesitate to make a change anytime integrity and transparency  to  the  public  are  at  stake.  At  the  same  time, the anticipated end of the DOJ consent decree is a major turning point for APD. Mayor Keller held 29 completed paragraphs for 2 years since 2019, during covid.. I ordered City  Attorneys  to  release  them  to  the  public.  Of  course Keller took credit, but him hiding the completion of these paragraphs  was  dishonesty  to  the  citizens  he  is  supposed to be protecting.  We must  ensure that  what  comes  next  is not  a step backward,  but  a step toward lasting,  selfsustained reform and professional policing. That requires leadership that is transparent, accountable, and focused on both safety  and integrity. We need to develop a culture with a spirit of excellence where each APD employee is valued and will hold themselves and each other accountable to the citizens they serve. Keller also turned down 10 million in funding from  the federal  government,  a grant  without  a match to hire up to 25 officers, just because it was from the Trump  administration  at  the  time.  The  BCSO  took  the grants. The president at this  time made a public  comment that Chicago and Albuquerque refused fed money. The people of Albuquerque deserve a police department and a police chief  they  can trust.  I'll make sure we get  there.

## Q15

## How will you stop the open drug dealing and drug use in Albuquerque?

Open drug use and street-level dealing are unacceptable and they're contributing to crime,  addiction,  and a breakdown of public  order in too many  parts  of  Albuquerque which is  also contributing to homelessness.  Broken window theory,  if  you let  even minor crimes  go unchecked, it will carry on and get worse. As mayor, I will take a tough, targeted, and smart approach to address this crisis.  We need to enforce laws  at the lowest level which has not happened in 12 yrs.  We have a saying in law enforcement you can beat the rap but you cant beat the ride,  Also,  charges  keep building and mandated treatment needs  to be implemented as  part of the process. The Mayor will say  that  crime is  down.  The reality  is  that  citizens  are not  calling the police because they  are so used to officers  not showing up so they decide not to call. City wide problem response team, as well as ongoing support for the area commands. We need to hire more officers and give them the tools  to be proactive. APD has 900 officers  and only  250 on the streets.  We will weed out the non essential positions  at  APD and have every  officer and detective in uniform  enforcing the law,  even higher ranking officers  will  be tasked with law enforcement duties.

Crack Down on Open-Air Drug Markets: We will deploy focused enforcement in known hotspots using a combination of undercover operations,  surveillance,  and neighborhood-based policing.  Enforcing all laws  on the books.

Create High-Visibility  Enforcement  Zones:  In areas  with persistent  drug activity  we will increase uniformed patrols,  clean-up efforts  with other departments,  and coordination with businesses  and residents  to disrupt  criminal activity  and restore a sense of  safety.  Cameras, signs and kiosks

Hold Repeat Offenders Accountable: We will work with the courts and district attorney's office to ensure repeat drug dealers face real consequences,  not  endless  cycles  of  catch-and-release through proper investigations  and evidence.

Support Specialized Drug Courts and Diversion Programs: For nonviolent users, I support alternatives to jail that focus on recovery and accountability. But when treatment is offered and refused repeatedly, we must be prepared to take stronger steps to protect public spaces.

Require tact plans and problem originated policing projects.

This is about restoring order and offering hope. Albuquerque can't function if the streets are overrun with drug use and dealing. Under my  leadership,  we'll get  control of  this  issue and take back  our neighborhoods.

## Q16

If elected, would you expand, reduce, or maintain the size of Albuquerque's Government? If applicable, please explain where growth or reduction would occur and how.

## Please explain::

If elected, I would reduce Albuquerque's top-heavy bureaucracy while expanding frontline services that directly impact  residents' quality  of  life  and business  owners'  ability to grow.  Too much of  our city  government  is  weighed down by administrative layers and inefficiency. I will streamline management structures, eliminate redundant positions, and ensure that taxpayer dollars are going toward results not bureaucracy. However, I will invest in technology, software and  hardware  where  necessary,  AI  training  to  make systems and tasks less time consuming, and 'boots on the ground'  roles  like  police  officers,  EMTs,  road  crews, housing  outreach  workers,  and  inspectors  because  these are the people who actually keep our city running, safe, and clean. This approach isn't about shrinking or growing government for its own sake it's about making government work better so our citizens get the service they pay for. That means putting more resources into neighborhoods and less into  the  back  office.  We  need  a  city  government  that  is lean,  responsive,  and  focused  on  service  not  titles  and layers of paperwork.

## Q17

What specific plans do you have to improve Albuquerque's infrastructure and road conditions, and how will you prioritize and fund these improvements?

Improving Albuquerque's  infrastructure is  a top concern for residents  and businesses  alike who are frustrated by  potholes,  crumbling roads,  outdated drainage systems, and traffic  congestion.  I  will begin by  developing a strategic  plan to begin city  infrastructure cleanup to include.  We need to work  with state legislatures,  our congressional delegation to prioritize state and federal dollars  and grants  to fix roads. Prioritize oldest  first  and continue this  process  until all roads  are repaired. Make this  part of  our continuing request.

Launch a Citywide Road Repair Blitz:  A  data-driven audit  to identify  the worst  roads  and prioritize repairs  based on traffic  volume, safety  concerns, age and community feedback. Citizens must be part of these decisions.  This means faster fixes in the areas people use most, with timelines and vendor accountability.

Expand Preventative Maintenance: We will invest  in preventative resurfacing and sealing,  saving money  overtime and extending the life of  our streets.  We will  also maintain regular maintenance on high traffic  areas.

Modernize Traffic  Infrastructure:  Upgrade traffic  signals,  improve pedestrian crosswalks,  and enhance lighting and signage,  especially in high-accident  areas.  We'll  also improve ADA  accessibility  and bike lane safety  with proper signage and community  awareness campaigns.

Invest  in Drainage and Utilities:  Infrastructure means  more than roads.  We will  work  to modernize outdated storm  drainage and underground utilities that are prone to failure or flooding, especially during monsoon season, which will also help with early and regular maintenance.

Secure Funding Through Multiple Sources:

Leverage federal infrastructure grants and state partnerships

Utilize bond financing for long-term capital improvements

Improve efficiency  and transparency in city  contracts  to avoid delays  and cost overruns

Inspect the work to make sure contractors  are held to the highest standards, currently  there is  no accountability  for badly  resurfaced roads

Create a Public Infrastructure Dashboard: Residents should be able to see what projects are planned, underway, and completed along with timelines and budgets. Transparency builds trust.

Fixing our infrastructure is about safety, economic development, and quality of life. We will set realistic timelines based on capacity and make sure we are transparent with our constituents.
