## Q7

Economic development: Albuquerque business owners have reported that getting permits can take 6 months or longer, and needless 'red tape' stifles efforts to open or expand.What will you do to speed up business permits and other business requirements to encourage economic development, business expansion, and new businesses?

As a former small business owner, I know firsthand how frustrating and costly it can be to deal with delays in business permits and unnecessary  red tape.  Albuquerque cannot  afford to be a city  where entrepreneurs  feel stalled before they  even get  started. As Mayor, I will:

Fully  implement the One-Stop Shop created by Mayor R.J. Berry in 2010. This model brought key permitting and licensing services under one roof.  I'll  build on that  success  by  fully  digitizing the process  and cutting down on in-person bureaucracy.

- Establish a Business  Advocate within City  Hall-a single point  of  contact  who will help new and existing business  owners navigate city requirements quickly and efficiently.
- Implement firm timelines  and accountability  for permit  reviews,  with a "fast-track"  option for key  industries  and job-creating ventures.
- Launch a Small Business Roundtable, bringing local entrepreneurs to the table regularly to provide input, identify  bottlenecks, and shape pro-business policy.
- Stop increasing fees.

I  will be a partner to small businesses-not a roadblock. Two-thirds of all jobs are created by small businesses, and if we want to grow Albuquerque's  economy,  we must  create an environment  where local businesses  can launch,  grow,  and thrive.

## Q8

Homelessness: Albuquerque's homeless population has grown exponentially in the past few years and is creating problems for both the homeless and the residents of the city. Please answer the following questions:Do you support or oppose expanding legal 'safe outdoor spaces' for camps around Albuquerque?

## Oppose,

Please Explain:

I  oppose  expanding  so-called  'safe  outdoor  spaces.'  The City of Albuquerque has spent nearly $300 million on homelessness programs in recent years-and what do we have to show for it? More encampments, more public drug use, and more frustration for families and business owners across the city. We will provide people experiencing homelessness with real opportunities for shelter, treatment, and support. But if they refuse help, we will enforce the laws that  ban sleeping on city  streets,  sidewalks,  and parks. Compassion doesn't mean surrendering public spaces to chaos. The current administration let this problem spiral out of  control,  even instructing police not  to enforce existing laws. That's unacceptable. As Mayor, I'll restore common sense, compassion, and accountability to how we address homelessness-starting with law enforcement and real results, not more failed experiments like sanctioned tent cities.

## Q9

## What is your plan to deal with illegal encampments in the city?

Illegal encampments are a serious public safety, public health, and quality-of-life issue. As Mayor, I will ensure that laws banning illegal encampments  are strictly  enforced-period.  The Supreme Court  issued a very  clear ruling that  local  governments  can remove these tent encampments and that's what I will do.

It's  unfair and unacceptable to expect families  and businesses  to live and operate next to tents, trash, drug use, and human waste. It's unconscionable that  city  employees  are being asked to clean up biohazards  in parks,  sidewalks,  and alleyways.  We cannot  allow this to become the new normal in Albuquerque.

Those experiencing homelessness  will  be given every  opportunity  to utilize the shelter,  treatment,  and support  services  the city already provides. But if they refuse help, they will not be allowed to break the law or take over public spaces. Enforcement will no longer be optional-it will be expected.

The difference under my leadership? Accountability. Action. And a mayor who's not afraid to stand up for law-abiding residents  and restore order to our streets.

## Q10

Do you support using taxpayer dollars for homeless programs? If you support, what kind of programs would you seek to fund?

## Support,

Please explain::

Taxpayers have already spent nearly $300 million on homelessness in Albuquerque-with little to no results. Encampments are spreading, crime is rising, and residents are losing confidence in city leadership. Yes, I support using public funds to address homelessness-but the spending must be effective, accountable, and results-driven. On Day One, I will order a top-to-bottom audit of every public dollar spent  on  homeless  services  and  a  full  review of  all nonprofits receiving city funding. If programs aren't working, or if organizations are mismanaging funds, the gravy train ends.

## Q11

Will you cooperate with or oppose federal agencies regarding the deportation of those who have entered the U.S. illegally and are a threat to society?

## Q12

Crime: Albuquerque is in a crime crisis, and is one of the most dangerous cities of its size in the U.S. Please answer the following:How would you empower the Albuquerque police force to better address this situation?

As Mayor, I will hire a police chief who is a strong, inspirational leader - someone both officers and the public can respect and be proud of.

We will change the culture of the Albuquerque Police Department and put an end to the era of political micromanagement. It's time to take the handcuffs off our officers and let them do the job they were trained to do: fight crime and protect our communities.

We must return to proactive policing - a critical strategy  that was  abandoned nearly 8 years  ago, with devastating consequences. I will bring it back.

I believe public safety is the most fundamental responsibility of government. Under my leadership, we'll restore pride and purpose to APD.

Mayor Keller has taken too many officers off the streets and put them behind desks. I will reverse those staffing policies  and get more officers  on the streets  where they  can best  enforce our laws  and keep our citizens  safe.  I  will also drastically  reduce the bloated executive management of the department.

And let me be clear: 'Police' in the Albuquerque Police Department is not just a noun - it's a verb. It means taking action. It means enforcing the law. We will return to a time when our officers  are empowered, respected, and fully  supported to do just  that.

## Cooperate,

Please explain::

Yes, I will cooperate fully  with federal agencies, including ICE, when it comes to individuals who are in this country illegally  and pose a threat to public safety. We already have a serious  crime problem  in Albuquerque.  We cannot  afford to allow illegal immigrants who are committing crimes to remain on our streets.  As  Mayor,  I  will  give ICE  full  access to arrest records so they can identify and deport those who are in the country unlawfully and are breaking our laws. This isn't about politics-it's about common sense and public safety. Protecting law-abiding citizens should always come first.  And  under  my  administration,  it  will.  The  DEA  just made the largest  fentanyl  bust  in  American  history  and  it was centered in New Mexico and involved six illegal immigrants. This is what happens when failed leadership makes  our city  a  sanctuary  for illegal  immigrants  who commit crimes.

## Q13

Some businesses are afraid to call for police assistance when a crime is committed because they don't want to be labeled a nuisance property. What will you do to ensure that businesses are receiving proper police protection?

First  and foremost,  I  will never send letters  scolding business  owners  for not  doing enough to prevent  crime,  like the current  police chief has done. That approach is an insulting slap in the face to hardworking business owners who are already struggling to survive in Albuquerque's ongoing crime crisis.

Instead of blaming victims, I will make sure our police prioritize protecting businesses, not punishing them. Under my administration:

- Calling the police will never make you a nuisance - it will make you a partner in public safety.
- I  will end the practice of labeling businesses as nuisance properties simply for reporting crimes.
- We will rebuild trust between law enforcement and the business community, encouraging more - not less - cooperation.
- I  will  direct  APD to increase patrols  in high-crime commercial areas  and to respond quickly  and respectfully  when business owners call for help.

Businesses are the backbone of our economy. They deserve protection, not punishment. And under my leadership, they'll get exactly that.

## Q14

Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina was involved in a highly controversial car crash. The corruption within APD, including high-ranking officials on DWI cases, is alarming. On the positive side, it was recently announced that the Department of Justice consent decree will soon end. If elected, would you retain or replace Chief Medina?

## Replace,

Please explain::

Chief  Medina is  unquestinably  the worst  chief  in the history of the Albuquerque Police Department - period. And I will replace  him.  From  his  role  in  a  highly  controversial  car crash to the disturbing pattern of corruption involving highranking officials-including DWI cases-Chief Medina has lost  the  trust  of  both  the  public  and  the  rank-and-file officers. Leadership starts at the top, and right now APD is crippled by low morale, lack of direction, and public distrust. That ends under my watch. It is clear to most that Chief Medina was  given his  job because his  top priority  is protecting the mayor's political standing, not protecting the public. As mayor, I will appoint a respected, proven leadersomeone who commands confidence from officers and citizens alike and will get APD back to doing what it was meant  to do:  protect  and serve this  community  with honor and effectiveness. Like generals in the military, I do not believe the police chief  should be focused on politics.

## Q15

How will you stop the open drug dealing and drug use in Albuquerque?

On Day One, I will empower our police officers to enforce the law - without hesitation - especially when it comes to open drug use and street-level dealing.

The Route 66 corridor has become a cesspool of lawlessness, where drug use, trafficking, and encampments have taken over entire neighborhoods. That ends under my administration.

I will immediately implement:

- Tactical crime suppression plans
- Directed patrols targeting high-crime corridors
- Zero tolerance for open-air drug use and dealing
- Ending the Sanctuary City law for illegal immigrants who commit crimes.

We will clear the streets, dismantle drug networks,  and ensure that areas  like Route 66 are safe for families,  businesses,  and visitors again.

This is about restoring order, saving lives, and sending a clear message: Lawlessness is no longer tolerated in Albuquerque.

## Q16

If elected, would you expand, reduce, or maintain the size of Albuquerque's Government? If applicable, please explain where growth or reduction would occur and how.

## Reduce,

Please explain::

I will reduce the size of Albuquerque's government. Under the current administration, the city budget has ballooned by 57%, with a massive portion going to homeless programs that have delivered no measurable results. That kind of unchecked spending is unsustainable-and unacceptable. As  a fiscal conservative,  I  will:  ·  Cut  the bloated bureaucracy, starting with the elimination of many of the more than 250 political appointees, some of whom are making over $100,000 a year with little to show for it.  · Order every department director to conduct a full costcutting analysis on day one. · Prioritize core services like public safety, infrastructure, and economic developmentnot wasteful programs and political pet projects. City government must be lean, efficient, and accountable to the taxpayers. That's exactly what I'll deliver.

## Q17

What specific plans do you have to improve Albuquerque's infrastructure and road conditions, and how will you prioritize and fund these improvements?

This is a perfect example of misplaced priorities. The current administration has poured money into pet projects and political agendas while ignoring the basic  services  residents  rely  on - like safe,  well-maintained roads.

As Mayor, I will:

- Refocus city spending on core infrastructure, starting with a comprehensive assessment of road conditions across the city.
- Prioritize repairs and resurfacing in the most neglected areas, using data and public input to guide decision-making.
- Cut wasteful spending and redirect funds from low-impact programs toward essential infrastructure.
- Leverage state and federal infrastructure dollars more effectively - dollars we're currently leaving on the table due to poor planning and lack of leadership.

Fixing our roads isn't flashy, but it's fundamental to quality of life, public safety, and economic growth. Under my administration, basic services will no longer take a back seat to political vanity projects.
