## Q7

Economic development: Albuquerque business owners have reported that getting permits can take 6 months or longer, and needless 'red tape' stifles efforts to open or expand.What will you do to speed up business permits and other business requirements to encourage economic development, business expansion, and new businesses?

I  bring a strong track  record in economic  and business  development,  including managing complex  operations  as  Deputy  County Manager for Sandoval County and a decade as Economic Development Director for Bernalillo County. I understand how frustrating it is when red tape and long wait  times  stall progress  and am currently  working with businesses  who the permitting process  is  hurting.  My vision for Albuquerque is  a city  where small  businesses  and developers  can thrive,  not  struggle to navigate an outdated system.

We must  overhaul  the permitting process  to make it  clear,  concise,  and consistent.  The construction industry,  in particular,  needs  a dependable and equitable process to keep projects on time and on budget. When the rules are unclear or applied unevenly, it leads to costly delays and discourages investment.

I  will  champion a fully  online,  user-friendly  permit  application system  with real-time updates  and a dedicated helpline to provide stepby-step support. Every application would be reviewed within a defined timeline. If a permit is denied, applicants must receive written guidance outlining how to correct  and resubmit  their application quickly.

Just as  important, we need to empower city staff with the tools, training, and authority necessary  to operate at the speed of business. Time is  money  for both business  owners  and city  government.  By  streamlining processes  and ensuring consistent  service,  we can make Albuquerque a city  that truly  supports  growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

That's the kind of smart, responsive leadership I'll bring to City Hall.

## Q8

Homelessness: Albuquerque's homeless population has grown exponentially in the past few years and is creating problems for both the homeless and the residents of the city. Please answer the following questions:Do you support or oppose expanding legal 'safe outdoor spaces' for camps around Albuquerque?

## Support,

## Please Explain:

I  support  expanding legal  and safe outdoor spaces  for camps. These spaces, however, should be considered temporary until we are able to substantially reduce the homeless population in Albuquerque. It is necessary to identify  the  reason  for  homelessness  and  seek  to  address the unique needs of each homeless person or family. There are  four  (4)  types  of  homelessness.  ●  Chronic homelessness: Someone who has been continuously homeless  for over a year or has  had at  least  four episodes of homelessness in the previous three years. These people tend to be older and are often struggling with complex health issues,  disabilities,  mental  illness  or  addiction.  They typically  live  on  the  street,  in  a  car,  a  park  or  another location not suitable for human habitation. ● Episodic homelessness: A person that has experienced at least three periods  of  homelessness  in  the  previous  year.  Many  of these individuals are younger people who may suffer from health issues or addiction. Help at this stage is critical as episodic homelessness can quickly turn into chronic homelessness and issues can become more severe. ● Transitional  Homelessness:  This  is  the  most  common  type of  homelessness  and has  become more  prevalent  as  a result of the pandemic. This is a person who has become homeless due to a major life change or catastrophic event. These are individuals who don't have a 'safety net' of family support  or a  financial  cushion  to  fall  back  on.  Generally these are younger people and families  who turn to a shelter or temporary housing system for only a brief stay. ● Hidden Homelessness: This type of homelessness often goes unreported and undocumented. It includes those are temporarily  living  with  friends,  family  or  hotels.  They  have no guarantee that they will be able to stay long term and no immediate  way  to  find  a  home.  Their  struggles  and instability  are no less  difficult and must be addressed. Expanding legal safe outdoor spaces for homeless camps has  been tried in other cities  with some success.  I  am  in favor  of  this  approach  in  Albuquerque  but  believe  that camps  must  be a safe haven and would require a city budget to ensure there are resources for sanitation, security and support services that address the cornerstones of homelessness - housing, healthcare, mental healthcare, drug and alcohol addiction, childcare, transportation and support  for recovery  of  traumatic  events.  Camps  are certainly not a solution, but would be useful on a temporary basis until we can increase adequate, affordable housing.

## Q9

## What is your plan to deal with illegal encampments in the city?

The U.S.  Supreme Court's  June 28,  2024,  decision made it  clear that  cities  have the authority  to address  illegal encampments  on public property. This ruling gives Albuquerque the ability to take decisive action to protect public health, safety, and the integrity of our shared spaces.

As  Mayor,  I  will  take a balanced and compassionate approach.  I  understand the challenges  faced by  people experiencing homelessness, but I also have a responsibility  to ensure that  our parks,  sidewalks,  and neighborhoods  remain safe and accessible for all.  Homelessness  is  a deeply  complex  issue,  but  can be preventable and solvable.  Allowing encampments  to grow without  limits  is neither compassionate nor sustainable.

I  will  enforce the City's  Public  Camping Ordinance (O-24-58),  which generally  prohibits  camping in public  spaces,  with some exceptions. We will continue using a tiered response system that prioritizes  action based on the size,  location, and conditions  of  each encampment.  Outreach teams  will  offer support  and resources,  while the Albuquerque Police Department  will  identify  individuals, check  for outstanding warrants,  and issue trespass  notifications  on private property  when needed.

At  the same time,  enforcement  must  be paired with real  solutions.  Sixty  percent  of  New Mexico's  homeless  population is  in the Albuquerque area. Our current shelters are not built to handle the true scale of this  need. We cannot continue to warehouse people in overcrowded or inadequate facilities. We must invest in building a true continuum of care that includes transitional housing, permanent supportive  housing,  mental  health  and  substance  use  services,  and  job  assistance  programs.

This continuum must not only address the crisis we face today, but also provide a foundation for lasting progress in the years ahead. It is  time  to  treat  homelessness  as  a  complex  issue  requiring  coordinated,  compassionate,  and consistent  action.

## Q10

Do you support using taxpayer dollars for homeless programs? If you support, what kind of programs would you seek to fund?

## Q11

Will you cooperate with or oppose federal agencies regarding the deportation of those who have entered the U.S. illegally and are a threat to society?

## Support,

Please explain::

Yes,  I  support  using  taxpayer  dollars  for  homeless programs. Homelessness is not inevitable. It is the result of cycles of poverty, addiction, and at times, policy decisions. During the height  of  the pandemic,  we saw what  was possible when we chose to act. The nation came together to invest in housing, healthcare, and income supports to keep people from losing their homes. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act delivered the single-largest federal investment in addressing homelessness in our country's history. That was proof that with the right priorities, we can make meaningful progress. As Mayor, I would support using taxpayer funds to build more affordable housing, convert vacant hotels and motels  into safe shelter options,  and create a rental assistance program that also includes eviction prevention services. This means helping individuals and families stay housed before they  fall  into crisis,  which is  both more humane  and  more  cost-effective  than  trying  to  rehouse them after the fact. I will also ensure that Albuquerque continues  its  partnership  with  national  efforts  like  the Federal House America Initiative. This program brings together federal agencies and local leaders to rehouse individuals  and  families  while  accelerating  the  development of  affordable  housing  using  American  Rescue  Plan resources. While we want to deepen these partnerships, we must be realistic  that  federal funding may  be reduced or cut in  the  future.  Because  of  that,  we  will  need  to  work creatively and explore new local and regional strategies to achieve the same positive results. Solving homelessness requires more than an emergency response. It demands sustained  investment,  strategic  planning,  and  the  political will to act.

## Cooperate,

Please explain::

My administration will cooperate insomuch as we will not prohibit cooperation with federal agencies altogether, but we will limit the extent of that cooperation with regard to immigration enforcement. We will not use limited resources, such as personnel or funds, for tasks related to enforcing federal immigration laws.

## Q12

Crime: Albuquerque is in a crime crisis, and is one of the most dangerous cities of its size in the U.S. Please answer the following:How would you empower the Albuquerque police force to better address this situation?

Restore Trust  and Empowerment  for Law Enforcement:  The current  system at  the Albuquerque Police Department  has  left  our police officers  powerless and deflated. Under the current administration, criminals  are being released with no accountability. As Mayor, I will work together with other City, County and State agencies to ensure accused criminals are not released early and are held accountable for the crimes  they  commit. I  will  ensure that  police officers  have the tools,  resources, and the freedom to act under the laws  without the constant  frustration of  bureaucratic  red tape. We must  move forward to empower those who are sworn to protect  us.

Immediate Changes to Policing Procedures: As  Mayor I will take immediate action to change the current policing procedures  in the City of Albuquerque including, but limited to the following:

- Policies  and procedures utilized by  the Bernalillo County  Sheriff's  Office and the Albuquerque Police Department will be uniform in nature creating a standard for dealing with crime in our City
- Standards for the what constitutes use of force incident will be immediately changed so that there will no longer be an extraordinary  waste of  valuable police officer's  time in investigating incidents  where use of  force is  not  evident.
- Police officers  will  be authorized to use their own judgment  to determine if  an citation should issued or an arrest  should be made for a any  offense including but  not  limited to misdemeanor such as  causing damage to businesses,  defecating in public  or threatening behavior. There will no longer be any excuses.  If a crime is being committed the option of arrest will be left up to the police officers at the scene.

Police Shortage:  The City  of  Albuquerque is  experiencing a severe police shortage,  brought  on by  many  factors  going way  back  to prior administrations. It  is  estimated that  approximately  60 police officers  retire each year. Keller's  administration has  increased salaries  to a competitive level,  but  has  not  been successful at  hiring enough police officers  to maintain a safe City.  In 2023,  Mayor Keller said he's given up hope of hitting the longstanding goal of having 1,200 officers.  Instead of working harder to achieve his goal, he narrowed officer tasks  and decided to rely  on civilians  and technology  to 'fill in the gaps'.  This  is  totally  unacceptable.

Chief  Harold Medina claims  we have 'somewhere around' 885 sworn officers.  The truth is,  we only  have 260 officers  assigned to 'street duty'.  This means that at times, there are only two or three officers covering an entire area command. More must be done - no excuses.

## Mayling's  Plan

- Establish heavy recruitment aimed at military and veteran segments of our population.
- Create the first of its  kind PSA high school program to create a career path for high school students  to move into Public  Service Aid positions leading to becoming sworn officers.
- Step up efforts to actively recruit officers from around our State and throughout the Country to help us build our police force.
- Create task forces to target crime categories such as car theft, vandalism, property crime and shoplifting.
- Improve the current  call  for service system  to direct  calls  to proper agencies  instead of  requiring police officers  to answer all calls. It  is  estimated that  75%  of calls  for service do not  require the assistance of  a police officer. Currently, it  is  estimated that  police officers  can have in excess  of  50 calls  holding at  one time in certain area commands.  Directing calls  to agencies  that  can better service the needs  of  the community  will  free up time for police officers.
- Establish means of restorative justice for nonviolent  offenders
- Establish an extensive community  service option for youthful offenders  convicted of  nonviolent  offenses.
- Support and lobby for swift and harsh judgment for all violent offenders.
- Establish a Youth Task Force in order to engage young people and create opportunities.

Community Engagement and Direct Action: As Mayor I will continue the focus on rebuilding the relationship between law enforcement officers  and members  of  the Albuquerque community  through accessible forums  scheduled on a regular basis.  Residents  of Albuquerque will be able to voice concerns.  Feedback  from the community  will lead to real,  concrete action.  Public  safety  must  be

## 2025 ABQ Mayoral Candidate Questionnaire

viewed as a partnership.  My  administration will work  with the community  to ensure Albuquerque becomes a safe place to live and prosper. I will have an open-door policy with the citizens of Albuquerque.

Hold Property  Owners  Accountable: Vacant properties  in Albuquerque are a blight on the community  and a breeding ground for crime. My administration will incentivize property  owners  to fill these spaces  with businesses  that  serve the public.  If  properties  remain empty and are allowed to decay, owners will be held accountable.

## Q13

Some businesses are afraid to call for police assistance when a crime is committed because they don't want to be labeled a nuisance property. What will you do to ensure that businesses are receiving proper police protection?

As  Mayor,  I  would make sure that  all business  owners  and law enforcement  authorities  are aware of  what  constitutes  a nuisance business  within the City  of  Albuquerque. Simply  calling the police for assistance when a crime is  committed is  not  considered a nuisance. Under my administration, businesses  would be encouraged to reach out to law enforcement in the event of a commission of a crime. To be clear, a public  nuisance is  anything that is  injurious  to public  health,  safety,  morals  or welfare,  or interferes  with the exercise and enjoyment of public  rights. Businesses would only  be considered a 'nuisance business' if they  are in disrepair or pose a structural hazard or unsafe condition due to inadequate maintenance or, if  they  attract criminal activity  or create unsafe conditions  that violate City  ordinances  in relation to public  health,  safety,  or well-being. Under my  administration,  law enforcement  officers  would be trained on the specifics  of  nuisance properties  and would be able to inform business  owners  of  conditions  that  would constitute a nuisance property and remedies afforded under the law.

I  would continue to have Code Enforcement  address  issues  that  violate City  ordinances  and I  would continue to manage the Problematic  Properties  Program  that  focuses  on identifying and addressing properties  that  pose a public  nuisance,  such as abandoned, mismanaged or substandard properties that attract criminal activity. Business owners would be afforded and opportunity to address  and correct  any  such issues  that  may  pose a threat  of  being labeled a 'nuisance property.'

## Q14

Albuquerque Police Chief Harold Medina was involved in a highly controversial car crash. The corruption within APD, including high-ranking officials on DWI cases, is alarming. On the positive side, it was recently announced that the Department of Justice consent decree will soon end. If elected, would you retain or replace Chief Medina?

## Replace,

## Please explain::

If elected, one of my first orders of business would be to recruit and appoint a new Chief of Police who embodies the understanding  that  empowering  officers  and  fostering  trust in the community are essential for progress. The Chief must ensure that the police department has the necessary resources and autonomy to keep Albuquerque safe. They must  act  as  an example to the men and women on our police force and must conduct themselves in a manner in which is expected of a person of authority. There will be no excuses if I am Mayor of Albuquerque.

## Q15

## How will you stop the open drug dealing and drug use in Albuquerque?

I  would employ  a multifaceted approach that  blends  law enforcement,  public  health initiatives  and community  engagement. I  would establish a special unit at the Albuquerque Police Department to focus on arresting drug dealers and disrupting open-air drug markets by  conducting undercover operations  and instituting controlled buys  to gather evidence and arrest  offenders. I  would authorize increased police presence in areas  known for open drug activity.  I  would prioritize expending access  to substance abuse treatment and recovery  programs.  I  would support  and encourage public  health campaigns  in our schools  aimed at  awareness  and risks associated with drug use.  I  believe that  mental health issues  are often associated with substance abuse and,  therefore,  I  would expand mental  health services  to individuals  with substance abuse issues.

## Q16

If elected, would you expand, reduce, or maintain the size of Albuquerque's Government? If applicable, please explain where growth or reduction would occur and how.

## Reduce,

Please explain::

Before considering any  growth in Albuquerque's government, we will first look within to identify opportunities to increase capacity and improve efficiency. We must maximize the impact  of  our current  resources  and operate as a lean, accountable, and results-driven organization. Only after these options have been fully exhausted would I support growing the city government. If elected, I would support strategic growth-but only when necessary-in key areas that directly improve public safety, reduce homelessness, and foster economic and job growth. Expanding resources where they can have the greatest impact is essential to creating a safer, healthier, and more prosperous community for all residents. Any growth must deliver a positive return on investment for the public. If a program or department does not demonstrate clear, measurable benefits, we will not expand it. We will prioritize investments that reduce crime, address homelessness with proven solutions, and support economic  development and job creation.

## Q17

What specific plans do you have to improve Albuquerque's infrastructure and road conditions, and how will you prioritize and fund these improvements?

lbuquerque's infrastructure is the foundation of public safety, economic growth, and livable neighborhoods. As mayor, I will make infrastructure a strategic  investment-not  just  patchwork  maintenance.

## My plan includes:

Prioritize Site Readiness  to Attract  New Business: We'll invest  in preparing shovel-ready  sites  across  Albuquerque,  especially  in areas with economic  potential but  underutilized land.  That  means  building out  roads,  utilities,  and broadband access  to make it  easier for companies  to choose Albuquerque.  Business  recruitment  starts  with infrastructure.

Strategic  Infrastructure Investments  to Support  Economic  Growth:  I  will  direct  infrastructure dollars  to support  job-creating developments-like industrial  parks,  innovation districts,  and commercial  corridors.  These investments  will  align with economic development  goals  to attract  new industries  and strengthen our tax  base.

Repair with Purpose:  Our road repair strategy  will  prioritize not  just  worst-first  conditions,  but  also economic  and community  impactfixing major commuter routes, freight corridors, and access points  to business hubs. Safe, efficient roads  help people and goods move better across the city.

Public-Private  Partnerships  and  Smart  Funding:  We'll  collaborate  with  businesses  and developers  to co-invest  in  infrastructure, especially  when projects  create long-term community  benefit.  I  will also pursue competitive federal and state infrastructure grants,  and propose transparent bond initiatives tied to high-impact projects.

Equity  in Infrastructure:  Economic  opportunity  must  reach every  neighborhood.  We'll  invest  in historically  underserved areasimproving streets,  lighting,  sidewalks,  and drainage-to make them safer and more attractive for families  and future development.

As Bernalillo County's  Economic Development Director, I brought in over $1.4 billion in private investment and helped create more than 5,000 jobs.  I  know how to leverage infrastructure to drive economic  growth,  and I'm  ready  to do the same for Albuquerque.

Infrastructure isn't  just  about  filling potholes.  It's  about  preparing Albuquerque for the future. With the right  leadership,  we can grow jobs, improve quality of life, and build a city that works for everyone. With the right infrastructure and leadership, Albuquerque won't just  compete.  We'll  lead.  And businesses  will  be at  the center of  that  success.
